<p class="normtextblack">The public P.O. Box is aimed at fulfilling the long-felt need for providing a UAE address to people who don&rsquo;t own individual mail boxes.</p>
<p class="normtextblack">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normtextblack">For a small fee, people can now have a mailing address in the UAE, the charges for the services ranges from 50 Fils to AED. 3.00 per piece depending on the type of mail and weight.</p>
<p class="normtextblack">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Public P.O. Box service allows people to give these P.O. Box numbers to their friends and relatives. When a person excepts mail, he can go to the registered mail counter at the respective post offices and ask the customer service agent to check if there is any mail. One can then collect the mail after paying the specified fee.</p>
