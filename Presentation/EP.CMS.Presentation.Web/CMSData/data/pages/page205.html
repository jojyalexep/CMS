<p>Electronic Documents Centre (EDC), a subsidiary of Emirates Post Group, today honoured workers working on machines as part of the Thank You campaigned launched by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of UAE and Ruler of Dubai to mark the Accession Day celebrations.</p>
<p>Hosham Hubara, Manager of Printing Centre and Hosham Al Qasim, Finance Manager, Electronic Documents Centre, presented the workers with certificates and goody bags, as appreciation for the work they have been doing.</p>
<p>Abdullah Al Hammadi, CEO of EDC, hailed the campaign launched by His Highness to recognise the contribution of people working silently behind the scenes. He said EDC was very pleased to support this noble campaign that demonstrates the generosity of His Highness towards this class of people who often go unrecognised.</p>
<p>The program was in line with the directive of HH Sheikh Mohammed to dedicate this year&rsquo;s celebrations for recognising general labour staff, such as domestic workers, janitors, public transportation drivers, construction workers, technicians, office support workers and others in different categories.</p>
<p>The campaign encourages companies and people to show gratitude and give symbolic gifts to general labour employees who work tirelessly to improve residents&rsquo; lives.</p>
