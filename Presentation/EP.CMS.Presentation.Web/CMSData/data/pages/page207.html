<p>Emirates Post has urged P.O. Box holders to renew their subscriptions before January 31, in order to avoid fines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The P.O. Boxes can be renewed at all post offices, postal agencies and through the Emirates Post website (<a href="http://www.emiratespost.ae/">www.emiratespost.ae</a>) with payment through credit card. &nbsp;Those renewing at the post offices or postal agencies should fill out a form available at all post offices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subscribers who pay the renewal fees after the due date of January 31, 2013, will be charged a fine. Those renewing the P.O. boxes after February 28, 2013, will be permitted to renew after paying the fine, provided the box has not been transferred to another subscriber.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Emirates Post Group had introduced new improved P.O. Box bundles for individuals, from January 1, 2012.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of the four P.O. Box bundles, the all-new <strong>&lsquo;My Home&rsquo;</strong> service allows residents of villas to have a personal mail-box installed on their compound wall, so that mail can be delivered directly to and collected from their doorstep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>&lsquo;My Building&rsquo;</strong> service enables residents of apartments to rent P.O. Boxes in the premises of their building, such as in the lobby or basement, so that they need not leave their building to collect their post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The third option <strong>&lsquo;My Zone&rsquo;</strong> delivers post through P.O. Box shelters set up in selected residential and commercial areas that are much closer for customers than outlying post offices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>&lsquo;My Box&rsquo; </strong>service refers to the existing P.O. Box service where subscribers rent P.O. Boxes at post offices of their choice.&nbsp;</p>
