<p>Launched in 1971, the UPU International Letter-Writing Competition for Young People&rsquo;s raises awareness about the crucial role that postal services play in societies, foster composition skills and letter-writing enjoyment among the world&rsquo;s youth. Each year the UPU chooses a theme and the competition is then organized in member countries by their national Posts. To mark the United Nations&rsquo; International Decade for Action &ldquo;Water for Life&rdquo; 2005-2015, the 2013 competition has chosen the theme &lsquo;Why water is a precious resource.&rsquo;</p>
