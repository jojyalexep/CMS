<p>Emirates Post Group has opened a branch of Asian Gulf Travel &amp; Tourism in Sharjah Central Post Office.</p>
<p>The new branch was inaugurated by Mr. Sultan Sahoo, Operations Manager in 3<sup>rd</sup> Postal Zone, attended by Mr. Jeremy Skyrme, Director of Sales, Emirates Post, and Mr. Mohammed Ashraf, Managing Director of Asian Gulf Travel.</p>
<p>This is Asian Gulf Travel&rsquo;s eighth branch opened within Emirates Post locations. The travel agency already has branches in post offices in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Ajman and Fujairah. Across the UAE, the agency has a network of 42 branches.</p>
<p>The opening of a new branch of Asian Gulf travel agency in Sharjah Central Post Office is in line with Emirates Post&rsquo;s strategy of&nbsp; improving the overall level of services it offers its customers. The idea is to provide various government and non-government services at post offices to meet customer needs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to welcome Asian Gulf Travel to the Sharjah Central Post Office and we are confident they will continue to provide high-level travel services to post office customers and others,&rdquo; said Ibrahim Bin Karam, Chief Commercial Officer of Emirates Post Group. &ldquo;Emirates Post seeks to widen the basket of services available to our customers by signing up with companies like Asian Gulf Travel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are delighted to open an outlet in Sharjah Central Post Office, and committed to delivering travel and tourism services to post office customers and residents of the vicinity,&rdquo; said Mr. Mohammed Ashraf. &ldquo;As a growing travel company, we see tremendous potential in operating from post offices and look forward to working with Emirates Post for mutual benefit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Asian Gulf Travel branch will offer travel-related services during post-office timings from 8 am to 9 pm.</p>
<p>Since the launch of Emirates Post&rsquo;s new strategy in early 2012, a number of companies have launched their operations in post offices, including some banks, travel agencies and business centres.</p>
