<p>As part of the strategy to encourage ideas that contribute to the conservation of the environment, Emirates Post recently honored two employees for offering creative ideas that help reduce costs and protect the environment.</p>
<p>The two employees were felicitated by Mr. Ibrahim Bin Karam, Chief Commercial Officer of the Group, Mr. Sultan Al Midfa, CEO of Empost and Mr. Khalid Shahdoor, CEO for Information Technology, in the presence of heads of departments from the Group.</p>
<p>Yassin Hussein Balochi was recognized for his idea of reducing electricity consumption by linking various electronic devices and PCs to a single switch to shut down operations with ease at the end of each day. &nbsp;This resulted in running the PCs for just 16 hours, instead of keeping them running for 24 hours.</p>
<p>The second idea came from Hisham Al Zarooni &nbsp;who suggested that used ink cartridges should be sold to shops that refill cartridges, instead of throwing them in the bin, which adversely affects the environment. This will also help earn some revenue for the Group.</p>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Ibrahim Bin Karam said such initiatives are in line with the Group&rsquo;s core strategy and community responsibility in protecting the environment. He praised the efforts of the staff and their managers for nurturing creative ideas. He stressed that the Group supports all initiatives aimed at raising awareness of reducing costs and rationalizing energy and water consumption.</p>
<p>This felicitation is among the many activities organized by the Group to reduce costs and preserve the environment, including the Green Art Initiative, which presents awards to the best items made from recycled materials.</p>
