<p align="center">&nbsp;Emirates Post&rsquo;s &ldquo;Express Parcel&rdquo; service, which is available for 179 international destinations, has seen a significant jump in outbound parcel volumes in the first quarter of 2013.</p>
<p>The biggest increase of 114 per cent was seen in parcels to China in the first quarter, compared to the corresponding period in 2012. The second biggest destination was India which registered a jump of 41 per cent in parcel volumes, followed by Sudan which saw an increase of 29 per cent. Overall, the average growth in parcels to international destinations rose by 19 per cent over the first quarter of 2012.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The robust growth in our Express Parcel service is a result of enhancements introduced by Emirates Post to make the service more attractive,&rdquo; said Mr. Ibrahim Bin Karam, Chief Commercial Officer, Emirates Post Group. &ldquo;On another level, it reflects the accelerating pace of&nbsp; business activity in the UAE.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Explaining the salient features of Emirates Post&rsquo;s parcel services, Mr. Bin Karam added: &ldquo;The growth in parcel volumes can be attributed to factors like our excellent international transit times, easy accessibility of the 115 postal offices across the UAE and a price that is unbeatable in the market place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Customers who send international parcels through Emirates Post also benefit from favourable bilateral agreements with postal administrations in different countries and the Universal Postal Union (UPU), leading to reduced duties and taxes. For example, a 20-kg parcel to Saudi Arabia by air costs just AED 134, to India AED 206, to the UK AED 473 and the Philippines AED 373. This makes our Express Parcel service very cost-effective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emirates Post Offices are geared to meet the varied needs of individual and corporate customers for international parcels. Durable boxes in various sizes can be purchased at any post office. In addition, customers can also buy parcel insurance for a nominal fee, ensuring greater peace of mind.</p>
