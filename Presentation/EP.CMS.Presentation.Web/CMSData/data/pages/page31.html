<p><strong>National ID Registration </strong></p>
<p>Emirates Post Group and Emirates Identity Authority (EIDA) have partnered to ease up procedures for the Population Register and National ID Card programs, for the benefit of individuals and corporates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Emirates Post takes full responsibility for delivery of the completed ID Cards either at post office counters, backed by extended working hours in post offices (from 8 am to 9 pm in most post offices, and on Fridays from 9 am to 1 pm).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Customers are given a grace period of 90 days to collect the cards from a designated post office. In addition, applicants can track the ID card movement through Emirates Post website after it has been processed by EIDA, as well as receive SMS notifications when the ID card is ready for pickup. Those who do not have a personal P.O. Box, can make use of the Public P.O. Box service at the nearest post office to collect their ID cards.</p>
