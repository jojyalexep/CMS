<p>Emirates Post&rsquo;s stamp on the Ghaf tree won the third place in the &lsquo;Most Beautiful Stamp Competition&rsquo; of Grand Prix de l&rsquo;Exposition WIPA held in the Austrian postal service headquarters in Vienna, recently.</p>
<p>The stamp, issued in March 2011, celebrates the uniqueness of the indigenous Ghaf free which has long been an integral part of the UAE&rsquo;s environment and heritage. Groves of the Ghaf tree grow across the UAE but it is threatened by overgrazing and urbanization.</p>
<p>Mr. Ibrahim Bin Karam, Chief Commercial Officer of Emirates Post Group, said: &ldquo;It is indeed a great honour for Emirates Post Group to have one of its stamps being recognized among the most beautiful in the world. It is a testament to the high standards we have set for ourselves. Moreover, the award conveys the message that the UAE attaches great importance to environmental conservation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ghaf tree stamp was one of the most unusual stamps issued by Emirates Post for the benefit of stamp collectors. It contained a real seed of the Ghaf tree inside the stamp which is affixed on a Souvenir Sheet.</p>
<p>First created in 1981 by the organising committee of the Vienna International Postage Stamp Exhibition (WIPA) to honour the most beautiful postage stamp of 1980, the Grand Prix de l&rsquo;Exposition WIPA is now awarded annually. This year&rsquo;s jury consisted of postage stamp experts, including the Director of the Austrian postal service, Dr Georg P&ouml;lzl, and the CEO of MICHEL, Hans W. Hohenester. Three of the most beautiful stamps were selected from 65 entries.</p>
<p>The first prize was won by Liechtenstein for its innovative stamp featuring a dragon motif enhanced by state-of-the-art laser technology, the second place went to the Czech Republic and the UAE secured the third position.</p>
