<p>Emirates Post Group has advised corporate and individual P.O. Box subscribers to strictly follow stipulated rules, regulations and agreements as per Federal Law No. 14, 2007, or face penalties.</p>
<p>The move comes after several instances of violations of rules pertaining to the use of corporate and personal P.O. Boxes.</p>
<p>According to the rules, business owners are required to have a company P.O. Box for each trade licence, and the P.O. Box cannot be shared with any other company. For example, in any large establishment, each trade licence holder is required to have his own P.O. Box, and cannot use a general post-box for receiving mail.</p>
<p>Similarly, holders of personal PO Boxes are not allowed to use it for receiving company mail. They are required to upgrade to a corporate PO Box.</p>
<p>It is also an offence for a developer or a landlord to set up his own mail boxes for receiving mail. The operation of delivery and distribution is the exclusive responsibility of Emirates Post and violators will be penalised according to applicable rules. Developers who wish to streamline mail system in their projects can subscribe to Emirates Post&rsquo;s &lsquo;My Building&rsquo; service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The P.O. Box system is governed by specific rules, and Emirates Post Group has now decided to carry out inspections to detect misuse or inappropriate use of P.O. Boxes by corporate as well as individual users,&rdquo; said Mr. Ibrahim Bin Karam, Chief Commercial Officer, Emirates Post Group. &ldquo;We urge all P.O. Box holders to abide by the rules and make legally permitted use of their P.O. Boxes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Companies or individuals found misusing their P.O. Boxes will be fined and their P.O. Boxes would be locked until they comply with the rules and regulations, Mr. Bin Karam added.</p>
