<p>In an effort to support environment conservation&nbsp;programs, Emirates Post Group in association with Dubai Customs organised an awareness campaign on Endangered Species by sponsoring an information stand at the Central Post Office in Dubai.</p>
<p>The stand was open for three days from June 25 to 27 from 8 am to 8 pm. Staff from Emirates Post Group and Dubai Customs was on hand to educate the public on Endangered Species, including the Brown Bear, the Hawksbill Sea Turtle, the Elephant, the Nile Monitor, the Nile Crocodile, the Leopard and the Spiny Tailed Lizard.</p>
<p>Dubai Customs, as an enforcement body of international conventions and laws, considers endangered animals as restricted goods and monitors attempts to bring endangered species into the UAE. Dubai Customs believes the every living creature plays a vital role in the natural cycle of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The earth is a fragile planet and in order to maintain its balance each living creature needs to be protected. Emirates Post fully supports Dubai Customs awareness campaign which has been designed to highlight the dangers of harming endangered species,&rdquo; said Ibrahim Bin Karam, Chief Commercial Officer, Emirates Post Group. &ldquo;Through this information, thousands of our customers will get to understand the need to respect all forms of life, especially endangered species.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Khalil Saqr, Director of Corporate Communications at Dubai Customs, said this exhibition in the customer area of Karama Post Office attempted to show the dignity of endangered animals, and raise community awareness of environmental issues, especially since Dubai Customs is one of the leading government agencies that puts protection of environment and natural life at the forefront of its strategic objectives, as per relevant international conventions.</p>
<p>He said the campaign will continue throughout the year, dedicated to promoting ecological balance and contribute toward reduction of the illicit trade in endangered animals. He also highlighted the role of customs inspectors who receive updated training that helps them to detect smuggling of endangered species by through airports, sea and land.</p>
<p>He revealed that Dubai Customs launched in March 2012 a campaign on "Facebook" and "Twitter" on animals and plants threatened with extinction, and the list is updated periodically, in collaboration with organizations like Protection of Nature and the Environment and the Ministry of Environment and Water.</p>
<p>He praised Mubarak Al Shamsi, Director of 2<sup>nd</sup> Postal Zone, for his role in attracting visitors of different nationalities to the stand.</p>
