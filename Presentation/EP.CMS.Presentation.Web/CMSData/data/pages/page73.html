<p><strong>History of Postal Services in the United Arab Emirates:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Postal Services in the UAE date back to 1909, when the first Post Office was inaugurated in Dubai within the scope of the postal agencies operating in the Gulf region and was managed from Karachi by the postal administration of India and came under the supervision of Pakistan after it split from India in 1947. On 01/04/1948, it was managed as a British post office until the postal services became independent and was taken over by the government of Dubai on 14/06/1963.</p>
<p><br />The first post office opened in the emirate of Abu Dhabi on 30/03/1963. It was a postal agency under British Mail, until 31/12/1966, when the government of Abu Dhabi took charge of its postal services. During 1963-1964, a post office was opened in each of the emirates of Sharjah - Ajman &ndash; Umm Al Quwain &ndash; Ras Al Khaimah - Fujairah. These post offices were linked to Dubai Post Office for receiving and dispatching private mail through Dubai Airport.</p>
<p><br />When the formation of the United Arab Emirates on 2<sup>nd</sup> of December 1971, postal services were integrated, under Federal Decree No. (8) of 1972, which led to the establishment of General Directorate of Postal Services to manage postal items, provide postal services in the different Emirates, and issue stamps in the name of the UAE, instead of individual Emirates. The first postage stamp under UAE was issued in January 1973.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UAE joined the Universal Postal Union, based in Berne, Switzerland in 1973. The UPU is made up of a large number of the countries in the world, with today&rsquo;s membership standing at 189 countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Federal Law No. (4) of 1985, established General Postal Authority. To develop the postal service and upgrade the methods, Federal Law No. (8) of 2001 was issued establishing the Emirates Postal Establishment (Emirates Post) on 29<sup>th</sup> May 2001, with full legal authority to directly undertake legal actions necessary to achieve its objectives, and have its independent budget, attached to the Minister, and invest its services in accordance with the principle of public service, driven by commercial interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later on His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE issued the Federal Decree No. 14 of 2007 establishing Emirates Post Holding Group, which includes under its umbrella: Emirates Postal Corporation "Emirates Post", Empost, Wall Street Exchange Center and Electronic Documents Center. These subsidiaries are governed by the group through an approved administrative structure and transparent policies designed to enable all subsidiaries to achieve rewarding investment returns as per targets set by the Board of Directors which consist of the Group&rsquo;s President, Vice-President and CEOs of each of the subsidiaries.</p>
