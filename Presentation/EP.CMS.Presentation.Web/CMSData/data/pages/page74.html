<p><strong>Welcome to Emirates Stamp Club</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stamps have often been described as 'the visiting cards of nations'. In many ways they reflect the history of their countries, convey the sensation of travel to faraway places, depict strange landscapes and tell of the customs of many races. Many stamp designs portray famous people, provide information on historical events and of the progress of science, and other times tell us about art and architecture. <br /><br />Stamps of the UAE depict important subjects such as heritage, culture, environment protection, marine and wildlife, sport and many other national and international events.<br /><br />Stamp collecting is a fascinating and educational hobby, for adults and children alike.&nbsp; Emirates Post provides special services for philatelists in the UAE.</p>
