<p><strong>Accessibility Statementa</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Emirates Post is committed to making this website accessible to the broadest possible audience, regardless of technology or physical capability. To this end, we are working constantly to improve the overall usability of the site, using many of the existing international standards for accessibility on the Internet as guidelines.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or suggestions regarding the use of this site, please call us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Images</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We have made it possible to use our site without having to view graphics or images. All images on our site, other than those that are purely decorative, have suitable alternative text (ALT) equivalents.</li>
<li>The main navigation bar on the site uses images with alt attributes that make the links accessible to non-visual browsers.</li>
<li>Headings and subheadings on many site pages are styled using a text replacement technique that uses the Flash plug-in.</li>
</ul>
<p>In these cases, the original heading text is also left intact so that non-visual browsers and browsers without the required Flash components should work properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Text</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While we have used a clear legible font throughout the website, it is possible for users to change the text size by using the standard font-size controls in your browser.</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Links</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The target of all links is clearly identified and links are written to make sense out of context.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Links navigate to permanent pages whenever possible.</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Forms and tables</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All form controls are appropriately and explicitly labeled and may be read without style sheets.</li>
<li>All forms can be properly tabbed through without using a mouse.</li>
<li>Form validation does not rely on client-side scripts.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scripts</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>We are using non-obtrusive client-side scripts.</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Site content is usable without JavaScript support.</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Where advanced functionality requires JavaScript, an alternative accessible version is provided through a link on the page labeled, &rsquo;Accessible version.</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>The main navigation uses JavaScript to make a sub-navigation pulldown menu for each category.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>If JavaScript is turned off, this sub-navigation will not appear, but it is identical to the sub-navigation in the left navigation column in the section main page.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pop up Windows</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In visual browsers, a&nbsp; title attribute on links that open popup windows includes the phrase "opens in new window."</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Browsers with popup blockers should be able to access these external documents.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Visual design</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This site uses cascading style sheets for visual layout.</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>This site uses only relative font sizes, compatible with the user-specified &rsquo;text size&lsquo; option in visual browsers.</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>If your browser or browsing device does not support style sheets at all, the content of each page is still readable.</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Any information conveyed through the use of color is also available without color (i.e. text-based).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Access Keys</strong></p>
<p>This site uses the access key attribute. Most browsers support jumping directly to specific links by typing keys defined on the site. On Windows computers, you can press Alt + an access key; on Macintosh computers, you can press Control + an access key.</p>
<p>The following Access Keys have been defined:</p>
<p>0 : Home&nbsp;<br /> 1 : Search <br /> 2 : Help&nbsp;<br /> 3 : Sitemap&nbsp;<br /> 4 : About Emirates&nbsp;Post&nbsp;<br /> 5 : Terms &amp; Conditions&nbsp;<br /> 6 : Privacy Policy&nbsp;<br /> 7 : Accessibility Statement&nbsp;</p>
